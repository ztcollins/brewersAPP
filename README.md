# brewersAPP
used for JSON and upload

HI, Welcome to my brewer's application!

You can run the file by downloading the index.html file alone and opening it in a Google Chrome browser. The data can be interacted with by clicking on the names to
expand their data. The file requires a functioning internet connection with access to GITHUB as I am pulling the data from the uploaded github JSON file.

Thanks,
Zachary Collins
